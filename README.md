# LockBuddy Password Manager

Welcome to the **LockBuddy Password Manager** monorepo! This repository contains two separate implementations of the LockBuddy application for learning and practical purposes:

- **`lockbuddy`**: A version built with React and Tailwind CSS using local storage for persistence.
- **`lockbuddy-mongodb`**: An advanced version using MongoDB + Express.js as a backend, with a React frontend and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Both implementations provide an intuitive and secure interface for managing passwords, with attention to modern UI/UX.
